===============================

Basic game created using Javascript based on the classic, 'Frogger'. Assuming you have all the
files from the zip or repasitory, running it should be as easy as launching 'index.html' in a
modern browser with Javascript enabled.

Game play should be very easy to figure out, the only thing to be aware of is that after winning
the only way to play again is by reloading the webpage. I recommend jumping in at this point, but
if you want them, there are further details below:

- Movement is accomplished by the arrow keys
- Getting to the water will create a star
- Create a star in all 5 columns to win!
